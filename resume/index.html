    <p>I am a native of New Orleans, Louisiana, and a 2014 graduate of the University of Virginia. After four years of working in digital marketing in Charlottesville, I joined the University of Maryland's Philip Merrill College of Journalism for training as a multiplatform journalist.</p>

    <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;Experience</h2>

      <h3>Co-host/Podcast Producer/Web Editor</h3>
      <h4>It's Pretty OK</h4>
      <h5>February 2016 - present</h5>
      <p>I started a podcast about millennial life with two friends from college. We have posted 189 episodes to date, and started a website to house our podcast feed as well as articles on food, music and more. I am responsible for editing web content from our contributors and producing/editing each podcast episode before it is released.</p>

      <h3>Senior Specialist, Performance Media</h3>
      <h4>Merkle Inc.</h4>
      <h5>June 2015 - July 2019</h5>
      <p>I planned and executed digital advertising campaigns for retail, financial services and education clients, primarily using the Google advertising suite and Facebook Business Manager. I contributed to the "Digital Bowl," a yearly report analyzing how well (or poorly) Super Bowl advertisers supplemented their expensive TV spots with digital advertising efforts, and covered industry developments for Merkle's Digital Marketing Channels blog.</p>

      <h3>Editorial Consultant, UpCurrent</h3>
      <h4>Gannett</h4>
      <h5>August 2014 - April 2015</h5>
      <p>I produced all of the editorial content for a mobile trivia game based on news and current events, publishing six quizzes per day in a custom content management system. I also ran Facebook and Twitter accounts for the project.</p>

      <h3>Digital Producer, High School Sports</h3>
      <h4>WWL-TV</h4>
      <h5>August 2014 - December 2014</h5>
      <p>I ran a standalone high school sports website for a TV station in New Orleans. I published over 200 web articles, recruited a user-generated content network from local high schools and assisted in the production of the station's weekly prep football show. I also filled in on the station's web desk after the departure of a coworker, writing local interest stories for the station's website and cutting video from the morning show.</p>

      <h3>Summer In-Residence Fellow</h3>
      <h4>Gannett</h4>
      <h5>June 2014 - July 2014</h5>
      <p>I interned with a group of college students and recent graduates, developing new millennial-focused products for Gannett. My team's project, a mobile news trivia game, was selected for further development after the end of the summer program.</p>
